<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



To be frank i didnt get any cool ideas to build with twitter api ! <br>
but i noticed that people who logged out of twitter have restrictions in viewing images or media's of a user ,so i thought about building an app which will be fetching images from a topic or twitter trends without logging in. It's like a ripped of client version of twitte with just images !. 

Building a cool bot was better option lol !
but as the hackathon ends this is my project (it was fun debugging twitter api ) 
-happy hacking....
